# CORPAY-PROJECT
Developed a data-driven model to improve eligibility criteria for a corporate credit card cross-sell program. Analyzed customer behavior, payment history, and risk metrics to identify high-performing customers previously excluded and underperforming customers mistakenly included.
## Project Objective
As the company diligently continues the implementation of the Cross-Sell Program, aimed at
expanding the adoption of Universal Cards among existing Fuel-Only Cardholders, a pertinent
issue has arisen. It has become evident that not all customers who initially met the eligibility
criteria and opted into the program have demonstrated the expected level of performance.
Conversely, there are customers who did not initially meet the eligibility requirements but have
exhibited exceptional performance in terms of low risk, great payment history, etc. This
divergence in customer outcomes has prompted a need for a strategic reevaluation of the
program, specifically in terms of opting customers in or out.
# Primary Challenges
##The primary challenge at hand is twofold:

Opt-Out Dilemma: A segment of customers who met the eligibility criteria and chose to opt
into the Cross-Sell Program is underperforming, exhibiting low revenue generation, elevated
risk profiles, and poor payment behavior. The underperformance of this group raises concerns
about the program's effectiveness and whether these customers should be opted out to
mitigate associated risk.

##Opt-In Reassessment: Conversely, there exists a subgroup of customers who were initially
deemed ineligible for the program but have defied expectations by demonstrating low risk and
maintaining great payment records. The positive outcomes from this cohort beg the question of
whether they should be reconsidered for the Universal Card offer and potentially opted in to
harness their full financial potential.
