# CORPAY-PROJECT
Developed a data-driven model to improve eligibility criteria for a corporate credit card cross-sell program. Analyzed customer behavior, payment history, and risk metrics to identify high-performing customers previously excluded and underperforming customers mistakenly included.
# Project Objective
As our company diligently continues the implementation of the Cross-Sell Program, aimed at
expanding the adoption of Universal Cards among existing Fuel-Only Cardholders, a pertinent
issue has arisen. It has become evident that not all customers who initially met the eligibility
criteria and opted into the program have demonstrated the expected level of performance.
Conversely, there are customers who did not initially meet the eligibility requirements but have
exhibited exceptional performance in terms of low risk, great payment history, etc. This
divergence in customer outcomes has prompted a need for a strategic reevaluation of the
program, specifically in terms of opting customers in or out.
